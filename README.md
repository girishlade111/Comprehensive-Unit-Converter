The output updates instantly as you type.🔢 8 Conversion Categories: Includes Length, Mass, Temperature, Volume, Area, Speed, Time, and Data Storage.🔄 Dynamic Unit Loading: Unit dropdowns automatically update when you switch categories.⇄ Unit Swapping: A dedicated "Swap" button instantly reverses the "From" and "To" units and their values.Advanced Features🌓 Light & Dark Mode: A sleek theme toggle switch (☀️/🌙) with the user's preference saved in localStorage.📋 Copy to Clipboard: Easily copy results with a single click and receive visual feedback ("Copied!").📜 Conversion History: Automatically saves the last 7 unique conversions to localStorage.🔗 URL Parameter Syncing: The browser's URL dynamically updates with the current conversion, allowing users to share links to specific calculations.📱 Fully Responsive: The layout is built with Flexbox to work perfectly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.🤖 Gemini API Integration✨ Fun Fact Generator: Users can get a fun, relatable fact about their current conversion, generated by the Google Gemini API, making the tool more engaging and educational.🖼️ Screenshots<p align="center"><strong>Dark Mode</strong></p><p align="center"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://placehold.co/800x500/1E1E1E/E0E0E0%3Ftext%3DDark%2BMode%2BScreenshot" alt="Dark Mode Screenshot" width="80%"></p><p align="center"><strong>Light Mode</strong></p><p align="center"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://placehold.co/800x500/F0F2F5/1c1c1e%3Ftext%3DLight%2BMode%2BScreenshot" alt="Light Mode Screenshot" width="80%"></p><p align="center"><strong>Mobile Responsive View</strong></p><p align="center"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://placehold.co/400x600/1E1E1E/E0E0E0%3Ftext%3DMobile%2BView" alt="Mobile Responsive View" width="40%"></p>🛠️ Tech StackThis project was built using fundamental web technologies without any external frameworks to keep it lightweight, fast, and dependency-free.TechnologyDescriptionHTML5Semantic HTML for a well-structured and accessible layout.CSS3Uses CSS Variables for easy theming, Flexbox for responsive layout, and Custom Animations for the loading spinner.Vanilla JavaScriptModern ES6+ syntax (async/await, arrow functions) for all DOM manipulation, event handling, and application logic.localStorage APIUsed to persist the user's theme preference and recent conversion history across sessions.History APIThe replaceState method is used to dynamically update URL parameters without reloading the page.Fetch APIFor making asynchronous POST requests to the Google Gemini API.Google Gemini APIThe gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 model is used for generating contextual fun facts based on user-provided conversion data.🚀 Getting StartedSince this is a self-contained application, running it locally is incredibly simple.PrerequisitesYou only need a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/girishlade111/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/girishlade111/your-repo-name.git)
Navigate to the project directory:cd your-repo-name
Open the file:Simply open the unit-converter.html file directly in your web browser.⚙️ How It WorksThe application logic is well-structured within a single <script> tag.Initialization:On DOMContentLoaded, the init() function is called.It loads the user's preferred theme and conversion history from localStorage.It populates the category dropdown and then the unit dropdowns.It checks for URL parameters to initialize the converter with a specific state.Finally, it attaches all necessary event listeners.Unit Data Structure: All conversion data is stored in a central units object. Each category has a base unit, and all other units in that category have a conversion factor relative to that base. This makes the logic scalable and easy to update.Conversion Logic: The convert() function is the application's core.For standard units, it converts the input value to the category's base unit and then from the base unit to the target unit.Temperature has a dedicated convertTemperature() function to handle its unique, non-linear conversion formulas.Gemini API Call: The getFunFact() function is an async function that:Constructs a detailed prompt based on the current conversion.Uses the fetch API to make a POST request to the Gemini API endpoint.Parses the response and displays the generated text, with robust error handling and loading states.🎨 CustomizationAdding a New UnitOpen unit-converter.html and find the units object in the <script> section.Find the desired category and add the new unit with its conversion factor relative to the category's base unit.// Adding Nautical Miles to Length (base: Meters)
Length: { base: 'Meters', values: { ..., 'Nautical Miles': 1852 }},
Adding a New CategoryAdd a new key-value pair to the units object.Define its base unit and add other units with their conversion factors.const units = {
    // ... existing categories
    Pressure: { base: 'Pascals', values: { Pascals: 1, 'Bars': 100000, 'PSI': 6894.76 }},
};
The new category and its units will be automatically integrated into the UI.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome!
